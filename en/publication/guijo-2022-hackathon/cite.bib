 abstract = {Programming  has  traditionally  been  an  engineering  competence,  but  recently  it  is  acquiring  significant importance in several areas, such as Life Sciences, which is considered essential for problem-solving based on data analysis. This work is a case study framed within the need to improve not only the data analysis skills of life sciencestudents, but also the biological background concerning the given issue of engineering students. Using hackathon and teamwork-based tools, students from both disciplines have been made and challenged with a series of problems in the area of Life Sciences.To solve these problems, we established work  teams  trained  before  the  competition's  beginning.  Their  results  were  assessed  concerning  the approach to obtain the data, perform the analysis, and finally interpret and present the results to solve the challenges.  The  project  outcomes  were  assessed  using  structured  surveys  for  students  and  their  overall perception.  The  project  succeeded,  meaning  students  solved  the  proposed  problems  and  achieved  the activity's goals. These goals would have been difficult to address with teams composed of students from thesame  field  of  study.  The  hackathon  succeeded  in  generating  a  shared  learning  and  a  multidisciplinary experience for their professional training, being highly rewarding for both students and faculty members.},
