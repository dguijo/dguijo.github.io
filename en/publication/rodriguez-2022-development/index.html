  <meta name="description" content="Background and aims: The model for end stage liver disease (MELD)    and its sodium-corrected variant (MELD-Na) have created gender   disparities in accessing liver transplantation (LT). We derived and   validated a new model that replaced creatinine with the Royal Free   glomerular filtration rate (PMID: 27779785) within the MELD and   MELD-Na formulas.   Method: The “Gender-Equity Model for liver Allocation” (GEMA) and   its sodium-corrected variant (GEMA-Na) were trained and internally   validated in adults listed for LT in the United Kingdom (2010–2020)   using generalized additive multivariate Cox regression. The models   were externally validated in an Australian cohort (1998–2020). The   primary outcome was mortality or delisting due to clinical deterior-   ation at 90 days. The Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino test was used to   test calibration.   Results: The study comprised 9, 320 patients: 5, 762 patients for   model training, 1, 920 patients for internal validation, and 1, 638   patients for external validation. The prevalence of the primary   outcome ranged from 5.3% to 6%. In the internal validation cohort,   GEMA and GEMA-Na showed a Harrell’s c-statistic = 0.752 and 0.766,   respectively, for the primary outcome, which were significantly   higher than those of the MELD score (0.712) and the MELD-Na score   (0.742). Results were consistent in the external validation cohort.   Among women, these differences were more pronounced (see   Harrell’s c-statistics in the table). GEMA and GEMA-Na were   adequately calibrated and prioritized differently 43.9% and 41.8% of    LT patients, respectively. Patients prioritized by GEMA-Na were more   often women, had higher prevalence of ascites and showed triple risk   of the primary outcome compared to patients prioritized by MELD-   Na. One in 15 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA instead of   MELD, and 1 in 21 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA-Na   instead of MELD-Na. Among women, 1 in 8 deaths would be avoided   in either situation.   Conclusion: GEMA-Na predicts mortality or delisting due to clinical   deterioration in patients awaiting LT more accurately than MELD-Na   and its implementation may amend gender disparities. ">

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Background and aims: The model for end stage liver disease (MELD)    and its sodium-corrected variant (MELD-Na) have created gender   disparities in accessing liver transplantation (LT). We derived and   validated a new model that replaced creatinine with the Royal Free   glomerular filtration rate (PMID: 27779785) within the MELD and   MELD-Na formulas.   Method: The “Gender-Equity Model for liver Allocation” (GEMA) and   its sodium-corrected variant (GEMA-Na) were trained and internally   validated in adults listed for LT in the United Kingdom (2010–2020)   using generalized additive multivariate Cox regression. The models   were externally validated in an Australian cohort (1998–2020). The   primary outcome was mortality or delisting due to clinical deterior-   ation at 90 days. The Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino test was used to   test calibration.   Results: The study comprised 9, 320 patients: 5, 762 patients for   model training, 1, 920 patients for internal validation, and 1, 638   patients for external validation. The prevalence of the primary   outcome ranged from 5.3% to 6%. In the internal validation cohort,   GEMA and GEMA-Na showed a Harrell’s c-statistic = 0.752 and 0.766,   respectively, for the primary outcome, which were significantly   higher than those of the MELD score (0.712) and the MELD-Na score   (0.742). Results were consistent in the external validation cohort.   Among women, these differences were more pronounced (see   Harrell’s c-statistics in the table). GEMA and GEMA-Na were   adequately calibrated and prioritized differently 43.9% and 41.8% of    LT patients, respectively. Patients prioritized by GEMA-Na were more   often women, had higher prevalence of ascites and showed triple risk   of the primary outcome compared to patients prioritized by MELD-   Na. One in 15 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA instead of   MELD, and 1 in 21 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA-Na   instead of MELD-Na. Among women, 1 in 8 deaths would be avoided   in either situation.   Conclusion: GEMA-Na predicts mortality or delisting due to clinical   deterioration in patients awaiting LT more accurately than MELD-Na   and its implementation may amend gender disparities.</p>
