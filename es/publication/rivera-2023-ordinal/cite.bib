 abstract = {This paper tackles the Donor-Recipient (D-R) matching for Liver Transplantation (LT). Typically, D-R matching is performed following the knowledge of a team of experts guided by the use of a prioritisation system. One of the most extended, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), aims to decrease the mortality in the waiting list. However, it does not take into account the result of the transplant. In this sense, with the aim of developing a system able to bear in mind the survival benefit, we propose to treat the problem as an ordinal classification one. The organ survival will be predicted at four different thresholds. The results achieved demonstrate that ordinal classifiers are capable of outperforming nominal approaches in the state-of-the-art. Finally, this methodology can help experts make more informed decisions about the appropriateness of assigning a recipient for a specific donor, maximising the probability of post-transplant survival in LT.},
