Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied, together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest for clinical practitioners. Recent findings: In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the application of ML techniques to organ transplantation. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover, recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when dealing with a vast amount of information. Summary: Organ transplantation can benefit from ML in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor-recipient matching or to improve standard scores. However, a correct preprocessing is needed to provide consistent and high quality databases for ML algorithms, aiming to robust and fair approaches to support expert decision-making systems.","tags":["Machine learning","organ transplantation","liver transplant","unos database"],"title":"Machine learning methods in organ transplantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11 for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks.","tags":["Artificial neural networks","Sigmoid units","Pulse width modulation","Sound quality","Induction motor"],"title":"Validation of artificial neural networks to model the acoustic behaviour of induction motors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juan Carlos Fernández","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pablo Salvador-González","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"67602fc203e3b94681a71986e8bdbbec","permalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.756815Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of convective clouds formation is a very important problem in different areas such as agriculture, natural hazards prevention or transport-related facilities, among others. In this paper we evaluate the capacity of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks to predict the formation of convective clouds, tackling the problem as a classification task. We use data from Madrid-Barajas airport, including variables and indices derived from the Madrid-Barajas airport radiosonde station. As objective variable, we use the cloud information contained in the METAR and SPECI meteorological reports from the same airport and we consider a prediction time-horizon of 12 hours. The performance of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks has been discussed and analysed, including three types of basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Product Unit and Radial Basis Function), and two types of models, a mono-objective evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimised by the two objective functions simultaneously. We show that some of the developed neuro-evolutionary models obtain high quality solutions to this problem, due to its high unbalance characteristic.","tags":["Convection initialization prediction","machine learning algorithms","neural networks","unbalanced databases"],"title":"Prediction of convective clouds formation using evolutionary neural computation techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Julia Sanz-Justo","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"a4e854e761b0734ad77a7e14acbb6161","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:54.140066Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of low-visibility events is very important in many human activities, and crucial in transportation facilities such as airports, where they can cause severe impact in flight scheduling and safety. The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of low-visibility events due to fog using ordinal classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Antonio Gómez-Orellana","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612884,"objectID":"fe664a72d4d11129e5f2418b80df766e","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-ideal-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:28:04.338721Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-ideal-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management. Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well-suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers instead of nominal ones. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska and South Kodiak. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.","tags":["Wave height prediction","Distribution fitting","Time series discretisation","Autoregressive models","Ordinal classification"],"title":"Distribution-Based Discretisation and Ordinal Classification Applied to Wave Height Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Alicia Troncoso","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612146,"objectID":"a9e7f7b1568d7595eefd9431a265b1ad","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-time/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:15:46.406357Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-time/","section":"publication","summary":"Time series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmentation. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.","tags":[],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"e51755b6c91590bcd58c3c7662905603","permalink":"/es/publication/duran-2018-bioma/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:57.901225Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/duran-2018-bioma/","section":"publication","summary":"The amount of data available in time series is recently increasing in an exponential way, making difficult time series preprocessing and analysis. This paper adapts different methods for time series representation, which are based on time series segmentation. Specifically, we consider a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and its barebones exploitation version (BBePSO). Moreover, a new variant of the BBePSO algorithm is proposed, which takes into account the ositions of the particles throughout the generations, where those close in time are given more importance. This methodology is referred to as weighted BBePSO (WBBePSO). The solutions obtained by all the algorithms are finally hybridised with a local search algorithm, combining simple segmentation strategies (Top-Down and Bottom-Up). WBBePSO is tested in 13 time series and compared against the rest of algorithms, showing that it leads to the best results and obtains consistent representations.","tags":[],"title":"Hybrid Weighted Barebones Exploiting Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Time Series Representation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"8fdeb9045c7899d3af0a388eecd0039b","permalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:58.147068Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Time series segmentation can be approached using metaheuristics procedures such as genetic algorithms (GAs) methods, with the purpose of automatically finding segments and determine similarities in the time series with the lowest possible clustering error.

In this paper we tackle a specific problem of significant wave height time series segmentation, with application in coastal and ocean engineering. The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico). The results show that the CRO performance is better than the GA in this problem of time series segmentation, due to the better exploration of the search space obtained with the CRO.","tags":[],"title":"A coral reef optimization algorithm for wave height time series segmentation problems ","type":"publication"}]
