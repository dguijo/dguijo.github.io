This problem consists in classifying time series with labels that show a natural order between them. In this paper, an approach is proposed based on the Shapelet Transform (ST) specifically adapted to ordinal classification. ST consists of two different steps: 1) the shapelet extraction procedure and its evaluation; and 2) the classifier learning using the transformed dataset. In this way, regarding the first step, 3 ordinal shapelet quality measures are proposed to assess the shapelets extracted, and, for the second step, an ordinal classifier is applied once the transformed dataset has been constructed. An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR Time Series Classification (TSC) repository. The results show that a support vector ordinal classifier applied to the ST using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2) is the combination achieving the best resultsin terms of two evaluation metrics: accuracy and average mean absolute error. A final comparison against three of the most popular and compet-itive nominal TSC techniques is performed, demonstrating that ordinal approaches can achieve higher performances even in terms of accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Ordinal versus nominal time series classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Anthony Bagnall","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"762c6c61f6bd59d52bb8fffe96f29741","permalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.534319Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Nominal time series classification has been widely developed over the last years. However, to the best of our knowledge, ordinal classification of time series is an unexplored field, and this paper proposes a first approach in the context of the shapelet transform (ST). For those time series dataset where there is a natural order between the labels and the number of classes is higher than 2, nominal classifiers are not capable of achieving the best results, because the models impose the same cost of misclassification to all the errors, regardless the difference between the predicted and the ground-truth. In this sense, we consider four different evaluation metrics to do so, three of them of an ordinal nature. The first one is the widely known Information Gain (IG), proved to be very competitive for ST methods, whereas the remaining three measures try to boost the order information by refining the quality measure. These three measures are a reformulation of the Fisher score, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ), and finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R²). An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR time series classification repository, 4 classifiers (2 of them of nominal nature, whereas the other 2 are of ordinal nature) and 2 performance measures (correct classification rate, CCR, and average mean absolute error, AMAE). The results show that, for both performance metrics, the ST quality metric based on R² is able to obtain the best results, specially for AMAE, for which the differences are statistically significant in favour of R².","tags":[],"title":"Time series ordinal classification via shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11 for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks.","tags":["Artificial neural networks","Sigmoid units","Pulse width modulation","Sound quality","Induction motor"],"title":"Validation of artificial neural networks to model the acoustic behaviour of induction motors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**David Guijo-Rubio**","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"a81c21ce816c214708181714ca9cb76a","permalink":"/es/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.415905Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a novel approach to tackle simultaneously short- and long-term energy flux prediction (specifically, at 6h, 12h, 24h and 48h time horizons). The methodology proposed is based on the Multi-Task Learning paradigm in order to solve the four problems with a single model. We consider Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (MTEANN) with four outputs, one for each time prediction horizon. For this purpose, three buoys located at the Gulf of Alaska are considered. Measurements collected by these buoys are used to obtain the target values of energy flux, whereas, only reanalysis data are used as input values, allowing the applicability to other locations. The performance of three different basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Radial Basis Function and Product Unit) are compared against some popular stateof-the-art approaches such as Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector Regressors. The results show that MTEANN methodology using Sigmoidal Units in the hidden layer and a linear output achieves the best performance. In this way, the multi-task methodology is an excellent and lower-complexity approach for energy flux prediction at both short- and long-term prediction time horizons. Furthermore, the results also confirm that reanalysis data is enough for describing well the problem tackled.","tags":["Ocean Engineering","Flux of energy prediction"],"title":"Short- and long-term energy flux prediction using Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Alicia Troncoso","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"778bd0091fe39acced556c5e1f0fba6d","permalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.206767Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Time-series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance mea- sure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different sub- sequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time-series objects of the dataset. In this article, we propose a novel technique of time-series clustering consisting of two clustering stages. In a first step, a least-squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all of the segments are pro- jected into the same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statisti- cal features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another spe- cific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time-series objects are grouped. We consider internal clus- tering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against three state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising, especially on larger datasets.","tags":["Time series clustering","data mining","segmentation","feature extraction"],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Rivero-Juárez","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Téllez","Rosario Palacios","Dolores Merino","Juan Macías","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Antonio Rivero","César Hervás-Mart\\ńez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"95436819a8720f2c457e0ae03855ea0c","permalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.989254Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics.

This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable \"recent PWID\" is compulsory due to its importance. The simplicity of the model means that it is possible to analyse the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of belonging to the treated group.","tags":["Hepatitis C Virus","Artificial Neural Networks","Typology of patients"],"title":"Using machine learning methods to determine a typology of patients with HIV-HCV infection to be treated with antivirals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","R.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"2a999e51e7af13b3f158e30e5c1929cc","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.697745Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management.
