This problem consists in classifying time series with labels that show a natural order between them. In this paper, an approach is proposed based on the Shapelet Transform (ST) specifically adapted to ordinal classification. ST consists of two different steps: 1) the shapelet extraction procedure and its evaluation; and 2) the classifier learning using the transformed dataset. In this way, regarding the first step, 3 ordinal shapelet quality measures are proposed to assess the shapelets extracted, and, for the second step, an ordinal classifier is applied once the transformed dataset has been constructed. An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR Time Series Classification (TSC) repository. The results show that a support vector ordinal classifier applied to the ST using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2) is the combination achieving the best resultsin terms of two evaluation metrics: accuracy and average mean absolute error. A final comparison against three of the most popular and compet-itive nominal TSC techniques is performed, demonstrating that ordinal approaches can achieve higher performances even in terms of accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Ordinal versus nominal time series classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11 for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks.","tags":["Artificial neural networks","Sigmoid units","Pulse width modulation","Sound quality","Induction motor"],"title":"Validation of artificial neural networks to model the acoustic behaviour of induction motors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Rivero-Juárez","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Téllez","Rosario Palacios","Dolores Merino","Juan Macías","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Antonio Rivero","César Hervás-Mart\\ńez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"95436819a8720f2c457e0ae03855ea0c","permalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.989254Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics. Based on neural network techniques, our objective was to identify those factors for HIV/HCV co-infected patients (to which clinicians have given careful consideration before treatment uptake) that have not being included among the prioritisation criteria. This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable \"recent PWID\" is compulsory due to its importance. The simplicity of the model means that it is possible to analyse the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of belonging to the treated group.","tags":["Hepatitis C Virus","Artificial Neural Networks","Typology of patients"],"title":"Using machine learning methods to determine a typology of patients with HIV-HCV infection to be treated with antivirals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","R.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"2a999e51e7af13b3f158e30e5c1929cc","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.697745Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management.

Este tipo de eventos pueden llegar a suponer costes materiales e incluso humanos muy importantes. Uno de los sectores más influenciados por las condiciones de muy baja visibilidad son los medios de transporte, fundamen- talmente el transporte aéreo, cuya actividad se ve seriamente mermada, provocando retrasos, cancelaciones y, en el peor de los casos, terribles accidentes. En el aeropuerto de Valladolid son muy frecuentes las situaciones de baja visibilidad por niebla, especialmente en los meses considerados de invierno (noviembre, diciembre, enero y febrero). Esto afecta de forma directa a la manera en la que operan los vuelos de este aeropuerto. De esta forma, es muy importante conocer las posibles condiciones de niebla a corto plazo para aplicar procedimientos de seguridad y organización dentro del aeropuerto. En el presente artı́culo se propone el uso de diferentes modelos de ventanas dinámicas y estáticas junto con clasificadores de aprendizaje automático, para la predicción de niveles de niebla. En lugar de abordar el problema como una tarea de regresión, la variable de interés para la caracterización del nivel de visibilidad en el aeropuerto (Rango Visual de Pista, RVR) se discretiza en 3 categorı́as, lo que aporta mayor robustez a los modelos de clasificación obtenidos. Los resultados indican que una combinación de ventana dinámica con ventana estática, junto con modelos de clasificación basados en Gradient Boosted Trees es la metodologı́a que proporciona los mejores resultados.","tags":["Series temporales","Eventos de baja visibilidad","modelos autorregresivos","predicción"],"title":"Algoritmos de aprendizaje automático para predicción de niveles de niebla usando ventanas estáticas y dinámicas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Dorado-Moreno","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","L.

This is a problem of high interest, because WPREs increases the maintenance costs of wind farms and hinders the energy production. The standard echo state network architecture is modified by replacing the linear regression used to compute the reservoir outputs by a nonlinear support vector machine, and past ramp function values are combined with reanalysis data to perform the prediction. Another novelty of the study is that we will predict three type of events (negative ramps, non-ramps and positive ramps), instead of binary classification of ramps, given that the type of ramp can be crucial for the correct maintenance of the farm. The model proposed obtains satisfying results, being able to correctly predict around 70% of WPREs and outperforming other models.","tags":[],"title":"Multiclass Prediction of Wind Power Ramp Events Combining Reservoir Computing and Support Vector Machines","type":"publication"}]
