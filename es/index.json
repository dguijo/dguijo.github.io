This problem consists in classifying time series with labels that show a natural order between them. In this paper, an approach is proposed based on the Shapelet Transform (ST) specifically adapted to ordinal classification. ST consists of two different steps: 1) the shapelet extraction procedure and its evaluation; and 2) the classifier learning using the transformed dataset. In this way, regarding the first step, 3 ordinal shapelet quality measures are proposed to assess the shapelets extracted, and, for the second step, an ordinal classifier is applied once the transformed dataset has been constructed. An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR Time Series Classification (TSC) repository. The results show that a support vector ordinal classifier applied to the ST using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2) is the combination achieving the best resultsin terms of two evaluation metrics: accuracy and average mean absolute error. A final comparison against three of the most popular and compet-itive nominal TSC techniques is performed, demonstrating that ordinal approaches can achieve higher performances even in terms of accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Ordinal versus nominal time series classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"74978e3ca12f3ab2edcd17c8e7b5ca62","permalink":"/es/publication/coot-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.21663Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/coot-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose of review: Machine Learning techniques play an important role in organ transplantation. Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied, together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest for clinical practitioners. Recent findings: In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the application of ML techniques to organ transplantation. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover, recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when dealing with a vast amount of information. Summary: Organ transplantation can benefit from ML in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor-recipient matching or to improve standard scores.

However, to the best of our knowledge, ordinal classification of time series is an unexplored field, and this paper proposes a first approach in the context of the shapelet transform (ST). For those time series dataset where there is a natural order between the labels and the number of classes is higher than 2, nominal classifiers are not capable of achieving the best results, because the models impose the same cost of misclassification to all the errors, regardless the difference between the predicted and the ground-truth. In this sense, we consider four different evaluation metrics to do so, three of them of an ordinal nature. The first one is the widely known Information Gain (IG), proved to be very competitive for ST methods, whereas the remaining three measures try to boost the order information by refining the quality measure. These three measures are a reformulation of the Fisher score, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ), and finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R²). An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR time series classification repository, 4 classifiers (2 of them of nominal nature, whereas the other 2 are of ordinal nature) and 2 performance measures (correct classification rate, CCR, and average mean absolute error, AMAE). The results show that, for both performance metrics, the ST quality metric based on R² is able to obtain the best results, specially for AMAE, for which the differences are statistically significant in favour of R².","tags":[],"title":"Time series ordinal classification via shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juilia Sanz-Justo","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sara Cornejo-Bueno","César Hervás-Martínez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"54155177fa9a3f3eee4e78601fa7ac19","permalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.411852Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we tackle a problem of convective situations analysis at Adolfo-Suarez Madrid-Barajas International Airport (Spain), based on Ordinal Regression algorithms. The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems. The SVORIM algorithm shows a good accuracy in the case of thunderstorms and Cumulonimbus clouds, which represent a real hazard for the airport operations.","tags":["Convective clouds","Convective analysis","Airports","Machine learning techniques","Ordinal regression"],"title":"Ordinal regression algorithms for the analysis of convective situations over Madrid-Barajas airport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juan Carlos Fernández","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pablo Salvador-González","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"67602fc203e3b94681a71986e8bdbbec","permalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.756815Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of convective clouds formation is a very important problem in different areas such as agriculture, natural hazards prevention or transport-related facilities, among others.

Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well- suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de altura de ola mediante discretización basada en distribuciones utilizando clasificación ordinal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Comino","David Guijo-Rubio","Manuel Ruiz de Adana","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"1e01680d7aac19c8c497a5bb3d589977","permalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.745938Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","section":"publication","summary":"Desiccant wheels (DW) could be a serious alternative to conventional dehumidification systems based on direct expansion units, which depend on electrical energy.

The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of low-visibility events due to fog using ordinal classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"e51755b6c91590bcd58c3c7662905603","permalink":"/es/publication/duran-2018-bioma/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:57.901225Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/duran-2018-bioma/","section":"publication","summary":"The amount of data available in time series is recently increasing in an exponential way, making difficult time series preprocessing and analysis.

Moreover, a new variant of the BBePSO algorithm is proposed, which takes into account the ositions of the particles throughout the generations, where those close in time are given more importance. This methodology is referred to as weighted BBePSO (WBBePSO).

In this paper we tackle a specific problem of significant wave height time series segmentation, with application in coastal and ocean engineering. The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico).

The standard echo state network architecture is modified by replacing the linear regression used to compute the reservoir outputs by a nonlinear support vector machine, and past ramp function values are combined with reanalysis data to perform the prediction. Another novelty of the study is that we will predict three type of events (negative ramps, non-ramps and positive ramps), instead of binary classification of ramps, given that the type of ramp can be crucial for the correct maintenance of the farm.
