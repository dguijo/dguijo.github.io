The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.","tags":["Solar radiation estimation","evolutionary artificial neural networks","satellite data","physical models"],"title":"Evolutionary artificial neural networks for accurate solar radiation prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Anthony Bagnall","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"762c6c61f6bd59d52bb8fffe96f29741","permalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.534319Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Nominal time series classification has been widely developed over the last years. However, to the best of our knowledge, ordinal classification of time series is an unexplored field, and this paper proposes a first approach in the context of the shapelet transform (ST). For those time series dataset where there is a natural order between the labels and the number of classes is higher than 2, nominal classifiers are not capable of achieving the best results, because the models impose the same cost of misclassification to all the errors, regardless the difference between the predicted and the ground-truth. In this sense, we consider four different evaluation metrics to do so, three of them of an ordinal nature. The first one is the widely known Information Gain (IG), proved to be very competitive for ST methods, whereas the remaining three measures try to boost the order information by refining the quality measure. These three measures are a reformulation of the Fisher score, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ), and finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R²). An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR time series classification repository, 4 classifiers (2 of them of nominal nature, whereas the other 2 are of ordinal nature) and 2 performance measures (correct classification rate, CCR, and average mean absolute error, AMAE). The results show that, for both performance metrics, the ST quality metric based on R² is able to obtain the best results, specially for AMAE, for which the differences are statistically significant in favour of R².","tags":[],"title":"Time series ordinal classification via shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11 for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks.","tags":["Artificial neural networks","Sigmoid units","Pulse width modulation","Sound quality","Induction motor"],"title":"Validation of artificial neural networks to model the acoustic behaviour of induction motors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juan Carlos Fernández","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pablo Salvador-González","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"67602fc203e3b94681a71986e8bdbbec","permalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.756815Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of convective clouds formation is a very important problem in different areas such as agriculture, natural hazards prevention or transport-related facilities, among others. In this paper we evaluate the capacity of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks to predict the formation of convective clouds, tackling the problem as a classification task. We use data from Madrid-Barajas airport, including variables and indices derived from the Madrid-Barajas airport radiosonde station. As objective variable, we use the cloud information contained in the METAR and SPECI meteorological reports from the same airport and we consider a prediction time-horizon of 12 hours. The performance of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks has been discussed and analysed, including three types of basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Product Unit and Radial Basis Function), and two types of models, a mono-objective evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimised by the two objective functions simultaneously. We show that some of the developed neuro-evolutionary models obtain high quality solutions to this problem, due to its high unbalance characteristic.","tags":["Convection initialization prediction","machine learning algorithms","neural networks","unbalanced databases"],"title":"Prediction of convective clouds formation using evolutionary neural computation techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","R.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"2a999e51e7af13b3f158e30e5c1929cc","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.697745Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management.

Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmentation. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.","tags":[],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"8fdeb9045c7899d3af0a388eecd0039b","permalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:58.147068Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Time series segmentation can be approached using metaheuristics procedures such as genetic algorithms (GAs) methods, with the purpose of automatically finding segments and determine similarities in the time series with the lowest possible clustering error. In this way, segments belonging to the same cluster must have similar properties, and the dissimilarity between segments of different clusters should be the highest possible. In this paper we tackle a specific problem of significant wave height time series segmentation, with application in coastal and ocean engineering. The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico). The results show that the CRO performance is better than the GA in this problem of time series segmentation, due to the better exploration of the search space obtained with the CRO.","tags":[],"title":"A coral reef optimization algorithm for wave height time series segmentation problems ","type":"publication"}]
