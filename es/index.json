The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.","tags":["Solar radiation estimation","evolutionary artificial neural networks","satellite data","physical models"],"title":"Evolutionary artificial neural networks for accurate solar radiation prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Anthony Bagnall","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"762c6c61f6bd59d52bb8fffe96f29741","permalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.534319Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ijcnn-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Nominal time series classification has been widely developed over the last years. However, to the best of our knowledge, ordinal classification of time series is an unexplored field, and this paper proposes a first approach in the context of the shapelet transform (ST). For those time series dataset where there is a natural order between the labels and the number of classes is higher than 2, nominal classifiers are not capable of achieving the best results, because the models impose the same cost of misclassification to all the errors, regardless the difference between the predicted and the ground-truth. In this sense, we consider four different evaluation metrics to do so, three of them of an ordinal nature. The first one is the widely known Information Gain (IG), proved to be very competitive for ST methods, whereas the remaining three measures try to boost the order information by refining the quality measure. These three measures are a reformulation of the Fisher score, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ), and finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R²). An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR time series classification repository, 4 classifiers (2 of them of nominal nature, whereas the other 2 are of ordinal nature) and 2 performance measures (correct classification rate, CCR, and average mean absolute error, AMAE). The results show that, for both performance metrics, the ST quality metric based on R² is able to obtain the best results, specially for AMAE, for which the differences are statistically significant in favour of R².","tags":[],"title":"Time series ordinal classification via shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juilia Sanz-Justo","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sara Cornejo-Bueno","César Hervás-Martínez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"54155177fa9a3f3eee4e78601fa7ac19","permalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.411852Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we tackle a problem of convective situations analysis at Adolfo-Suarez Madrid-Barajas International Airport (Spain), based on Ordinal Regression algorithms. The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems. The SVORIM algorithm shows a good accuracy in the case of thunderstorms and Cumulonimbus clouds, which represent a real hazard for the airport operations.","tags":["Convective clouds","Convective analysis","Airports","Machine learning techniques","Ordinal regression"],"title":"Ordinal regression algorithms for the analysis of convective situations over Madrid-Barajas airport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Rivero-Juárez","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Téllez","Rosario Palacios","Dolores Merino","Juan Macías","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Antonio Rivero","César Hervás-Mart\\ńez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"95436819a8720f2c457e0ae03855ea0c","permalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.989254Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics. Based on neural network techniques, our objective was to identify those factors for HIV/HCV co-infected patients (to which clinicians have given careful consideration before treatment uptake) that have not being included among the prioritisation criteria. This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable \"recent PWID\" is compulsory due to its importance. The simplicity of the model means that it is possible to analyse the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of belonging to the treated group.","tags":["Hepatitis C Virus","Artificial Neural Networks","Typology of patients"],"title":"Using machine learning methods to determine a typology of patients with HIV-HCV infection to be treated with antivirals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","R.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro J.

Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well- suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de altura de ola mediante discretización basada en distribuciones utilizando clasificación ordinal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Comino","David Guijo-Rubio","Manuel Ruiz de Adana","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"1e01680d7aac19c8c497a5bb3d589977","permalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.745938Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","section":"publication","summary":"Desiccant wheels (DW) could be a serious alternative to conventional dehumidification systems based on direct expansion units, which depend on electrical energy.

Two different ANN models were developed to predict two output variables: outlet process air temperature and humidity ratio. The results show that a sigmoid unit neural network obtained 0.390 and 2.987 for MSE and SEP, respectively. These results outline the effective transfer mechanism of multitask ANNs to extract common features of multiple tasks, being useful for modelling a DW activated at low temperature.

The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them.

En este artículo se presenta un nuevo método de clustering para series temporales, mediante polinomios utilizando un método conocido como Growing Window. De esta forma simplificamos la serie a un conjunto de coeficientes lineales de grado variable, para, posteriormente, agrupar los diferentes segmentos y hallar los centroides de cada cluster. Al final la serie queda simplificada a n x d elementos, siendo n el número de clusters y d el grado del polinomio utilizado en la aproximación y es con esta representación con la que se realiza la agrupación final.
