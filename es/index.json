The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.","tags":["Solar radiation estimation","evolutionary artificial neural networks","satellite data","physical models"],"title":"Evolutionary artificial neural networks for accurate solar radiation prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Anthony Bagnall","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"f8504164439af3e6eeb5407a5cac301b","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-aaltd-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.329661Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-aaltd-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Time series ordinal classification is one of the less studied problems in time series data mining. This problem consists in classifying time series with labels that show a natural order between them. In this paper, an approach is proposed based on the Shapelet Transform (ST) specifically adapted to ordinal classification. ST consists of two different steps: 1) the shapelet extraction procedure and its evaluation; and 2) the classifier learning using the transformed dataset. In this way, regarding the first step, 3 ordinal shapelet quality measures are proposed to assess the shapelets extracted, and, for the second step, an ordinal classifier is applied once the transformed dataset has been constructed. An empirical evaluation is carried out, considering 7 ordinal datasets from the UEA \u0026 UCR Time Series Classification (TSC) repository. The results show that a support vector ordinal classifier applied to the ST using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R2) is the combination achieving the best resultsin terms of two evaluation metrics: accuracy and average mean absolute error. A final comparison against three of the most popular and compet-itive nominal TSC techniques is performed, demonstrating that ordinal approaches can achieve higher performances even in terms of accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Ordinal versus nominal time series classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juilia Sanz-Justo","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sara Cornejo-Bueno","César Hervás-Martínez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"54155177fa9a3f3eee4e78601fa7ac19","permalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.411852Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/tormentas-barajas-2019-atmos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we tackle a problem of convective situations analysis at Adolfo-Suarez Madrid-Barajas International Airport (Spain), based on Ordinal Regression algorithms. The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems. The SVORIM algorithm shows a good accuracy in the case of thunderstorms and Cumulonimbus clouds, which represent a real hazard for the airport operations.","tags":["Convective clouds","Convective analysis","Airports","Machine learning techniques","Ordinal regression"],"title":"Ordinal regression algorithms for the analysis of convective situations over Madrid-Barajas airport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**David Guijo-Rubio**","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"a81c21ce816c214708181714ca9cb76a","permalink":"/es/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.415905Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a novel approach to tackle simultaneously short- and long-term energy flux prediction (specifically, at 6h, 12h, 24h and 48h time horizons). The methodology proposed is based on the Multi-Task Learning paradigm in order to solve the four problems with a single model. We consider Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (MTEANN) with four outputs, one for each time prediction horizon. For this purpose, three buoys located at the Gulf of Alaska are considered. Measurements collected by these buoys are used to obtain the target values of energy flux, whereas, only reanalysis data are used as input values, allowing the applicability to other locations. The performance of three different basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Radial Basis Function and Product Unit) are compared against some popular stateof-the-art approaches such as Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector Regressors. The results show that MTEANN methodology using Sigmoidal Units in the hidden layer and a linear output achieves the best performance. In this way, the multi-task methodology is an excellent and lower-complexity approach for energy flux prediction at both short- and long-term prediction time horizons. Furthermore, the results also confirm that reanalysis data is enough for describing well the problem tackled.","tags":["Ocean Engineering","Flux of energy prediction"],"title":"Short- and long-term energy flux prediction using Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Alicia Troncoso","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"778bd0091fe39acced556c5e1f0fba6d","permalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.206767Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Time-series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance mea- sure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different sub- sequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time-series objects of the dataset. In this article, we propose a novel technique of time-series clustering consisting of two clustering stages. In a first step, a least-squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all of the segments are pro- jected into the same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statisti- cal features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another spe- cific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time-series objects are grouped. We consider internal clus- tering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro J.

Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well- suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de altura de ola mediante discretización basada en distribuciones utilizando clasificación ordinal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Comino","David Guijo-Rubio","Manuel Ruiz de Adana","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"1e01680d7aac19c8c497a5bb3d589977","permalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.745938Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/comino-2019-validation/","section":"publication","summary":"Desiccant wheels (DW) could be a serious alternative to conventional dehumidification systems based on direct expansion units, which depend on electrical energy.
