The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines.","tags":["Solar radiation estimation","evolutionary artificial neural networks","satellite data","physical models"],"title":"Evolutionary artificial neural networks for accurate solar radiation prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship. Focusing on the simple interpretable models, product unit neural networks achieved the best results: 38.77 for MSE and 13.11 for SEP. The main benefit of this product unit model is its simplicity, since only 10 inputs variables are used, outlining the effective transfer mechanism of multitask artificial neural networks to extract common features of multiple tasks. Finally, a deep analysis of the acoustic quality of induction motors in done using the best product unit neural networks.","tags":["Artificial neural networks","Sigmoid units","Pulse width modulation","Sound quality","Induction motor"],"title":"Validation of artificial neural networks to model the acoustic behaviour of induction motors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Juan Carlos Fernández","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pablo Salvador-González","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602672,"objectID":"67602fc203e3b94681a71986e8bdbbec","permalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.756815Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/ncaa-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of convective clouds formation is a very important problem in different areas such as agriculture, natural hazards prevention or transport-related facilities, among others. In this paper we evaluate the capacity of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks to predict the formation of convective clouds, tackling the problem as a classification task. We use data from Madrid-Barajas airport, including variables and indices derived from the Madrid-Barajas airport radiosonde station. As objective variable, we use the cloud information contained in the METAR and SPECI meteorological reports from the same airport and we consider a prediction time-horizon of 12 hours. The performance of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks has been discussed and analysed, including three types of basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Product Unit and Radial Basis Function), and two types of models, a mono-objective evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimised by the two objective functions simultaneously. We show that some of the developed neuro-evolutionary models obtain high quality solutions to this problem, due to its high unbalance characteristic.","tags":["Convection initialization prediction","machine learning algorithms","neural networks","unbalanced databases"],"title":"Prediction of convective clouds formation using evolutionary neural computation techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Alicia Troncoso","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"778bd0091fe39acced556c5e1f0fba6d","permalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.206767Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Time-series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance mea- sure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different sub- sequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time-series objects of the dataset. In this article, we propose a novel technique of time-series clustering consisting of two clustering stages. In a first step, a least-squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all of the segments are pro- jected into the same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statisti- cal features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another spe- cific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time-series objects are grouped. We consider internal clus- tering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against three state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising, especially on larger datasets.","tags":["Time series clustering","data mining","segmentation","feature extraction"],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Rivero-Juárez","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Téllez","Rosario Palacios","Dolores Merino","Juan Macías","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Antonio Rivero","César Hervás-Mart\\ńez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"95436819a8720f2c457e0ae03855ea0c","permalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.989254Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/vih-ann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics. Based on neural network techniques, our objective was to identify those factors for HIV/HCV co-infected patients (to which clinicians have given careful consideration before treatment uptake) that have not being included among the prioritisation criteria. This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable \"recent PWID\" is compulsory due to its importance. The simplicity of the model means that it is possible to analyse the relationship between patient characteristics and the probability of belonging to the treated group.","tags":["Hepatitis C Virus","Artificial Neural Networks","Typology of patients"],"title":"Using machine learning methods to determine a typology of patients with HIV-HCV infection to be treated with antivirals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","R.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Julia Sanz-Justo","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"a4e854e761b0734ad77a7e14acbb6161","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:54.140066Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of low-visibility events is very important in many human activities, and crucial in transportation facilities such as airports, where they can cause severe impact in flight scheduling and safety. The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of low-visibility events due to fog using ordinal classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Diaz-Lozano","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612697,"objectID":"6563fd3f68f5b81b7bae523ddece1580","permalink":"/es/publication/diaz-caepia-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:57.620571Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/diaz-caepia-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Los eventos de muy baja visibilidad producidos por niebla son un problema recurrente en ciertas zonas cercanas a rı́os y grandes montañas, que afectan fuertemente a la actividad humana en diferentes aspectos.

The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico).

The standard echo state network architecture is modified by replacing the linear regression used to compute the reservoir outputs by a nonlinear support vector machine, and past ramp function values are combined with reanalysis data to perform the prediction. Another novelty of the study is that we will predict three type of events (negative ramps, non-ramps and positive ramps), instead of binary classification of ramps, given that the type of ramp can be crucial for the correct maintenance of the farm.
