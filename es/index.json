Analysing the main tasks for which they are being applied, together with the advantages and disadvantages of their use, can be of crucial interest for clinical practitioners. Recent findings: In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the application of ML techniques to organ transplantation. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature aiming to find universal models by considering multicenter cohorts or from different countries. Moreover, recently, deep learning has also been applied demonstrating a notable ability when dealing with a vast amount of information. Summary: Organ transplantation can benefit from ML in such a way to improve the current procedures for donor-recipient matching or to improve standard scores. However, a correct preprocessing is needed to provide consistent and high quality databases for ML algorithms, aiming to robust and fair approaches to support expert decision-making systems.","tags":["Machine learning","organ transplantation","liver transplant","unos database"],"title":"Machine learning methods in organ transplantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"2a999e51e7af13b3f158e30e5c1929cc","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.697745Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-uco-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management. Traditionally, regression techniques are used for this prediction, but estimating continuous changes in the corresponding time series can be very difficult. With the purpose of simplifying the prediction, wave height can be discretised in consecutive intervals, resulting in a set of ordinal categories. Despite this discretisation could be performed using the criterion of an expert, the prediction could be biased to the opinion of the expert, and the obtained categories could be unrepresentative of the data recorded. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method to categorise the wave height based on selecting the most appropriate distribution from a set of well- suited candidates. Moreover, given that the categories resulting from the discretisation show a clear natural order, we propose to use different ordinal classifiers. The methodology is tested in real wave height data collected from two buoys located in the Gulf of Alaska. We also incorporate reanalysis data in order to increase the accuracy of the predictors. The results confirm that this kind of discretisation is suitable for the time series considered and that the ordinal classifiers achieve outstanding results in comparison with nominal techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de altura de ola mediante discretización basada en distribuciones utilizando clasificación ordinal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Julia Sanz-Justo","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619602674,"objectID":"a4e854e761b0734ad77a7e14acbb6161","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:54.140066Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-2018-fog-ordinal/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of low-visibility events is very important in many human activities, and crucial in transportation facilities such as airports, where they can cause severe impact in flight scheduling and safety. The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of low-visibility events due to fog using ordinal classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"8fdeb9045c7899d3af0a388eecd0039b","permalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:58.147068Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/duran-rosal-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Time series segmentation can be approached using metaheuristics procedures such as genetic algorithms (GAs) methods, with the purpose of automatically finding segments and determine similarities in the time series with the lowest possible clustering error. In this way, segments belonging to the same cluster must have similar properties, and the dissimilarity between segments of different clusters should be the highest possible. In this paper we tackle a specific problem of significant wave height time series segmentation, with application in coastal and ocean engineering. The basic idea in this case is that similarity between segments can be used to characterise those segments with high significant wave heights, and then being able to predict them. A recently metaheuristic, the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed for this task, and we analyze its performance by comparing it with that of a GA in three wave height time series collected in three real buoys (two of them in the Gulf of Alaska and another one in Puerto Rico). The results show that the CRO performance is better than the GA in this problem of time series segmentation, due to the better exploration of the search space obtained with the CRO.","tags":[],"title":"A coral reef optimization algorithm for wave height time series segmentation problems ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1619612698,"objectID":"56293fc55cac635487842e46d293404a","permalink":"/es/publication/guijo-jovenes-uco-16/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:58.465451Z","relpermalink":"/es/publication/guijo-jovenes-uco-16/","section":"publication","summary":"Durante los últimos años se ha producido un gran aumento de series de datos distribuidas a lo largo del tiempo, o lo que es lo mismo, de series temporales. Este crecimiento ha traído consigo un interés en su agrupamiento o clustering, proceso de agrupar las series de forma que, las series de un mismo grupo sean muy similares entre sí y muy diferentes a las de otros grupos. Cuando las series temporales son muy largas, presentan ruido o valores perdidos, muchos de los métodos actuales obtienen soluciones que no son aceptables. En este artículo se presenta un nuevo método de clustering para series temporales, mediante polinomios utilizando un método conocido como Growing Window. De esta forma simplificamos la serie a un conjunto de coeficientes lineales de grado variable, para, posteriormente, agrupar los diferentes segmentos y hallar los centroides de cada cluster. Al final la serie queda simplificada a n x d elementos, siendo n el número de clusters y d el grado del polinomio utilizado en la aproximación y es con esta representación con la que se realiza la agrupación final. El objetivo de esta nueva metodología consiste en disminuir la dimensionalidad de la serie temporal, la sensibilidad del agrupamiento y los datos perdidos.","tags":["Time series clustering","time series segmentation",""],"title":"Clustering de Series Temporales basado en la Extracción de Tipologías de Segmentos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Dorado-Moreno","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","L.

This is a problem of high interest, because WPREs increases the maintenance costs of wind farms and hinders the energy production. The standard echo state network architecture is modified by replacing the linear regression used to compute the reservoir outputs by a nonlinear support vector machine, and past ramp function values are combined with reanalysis data to perform the prediction. Another novelty of the study is that we will predict three type of events (negative ramps, non-ramps and positive ramps), instead of binary classification of ramps, given that the type of ramp can be crucial for the correct maintenance of the farm. The model proposed obtains satisfying results, being able to correctly predict around 70% of WPREs and outperforming other models.","tags":[],"title":"Multiclass Prediction of Wind Power Ramp Events Combining Reservoir Computing and Support Vector Machines","type":"publication"}]
