However, their performance is unsatisfactory in the Spanish population, where most cDCD livers are recovered using normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Consequently, we explored the role of different machine learning-based classifiers as predictive models for graft survival. A risk stratification score integrated with the model of end-stage liver disease score in a donor-recipient (D-R) matching system was developed. Methods: This retrospective multicenter cohort study used 539 D-R pairs of cDCD livers recovered with NRP, including 20 donor, recipient, and NRP variables. The following machine learning-based classifiers were evaluated: logistic regression, ridge classifier, support vector classifier, multilayer perceptron, and random forest. The endpoints were the 3- and 12-mo graft survival rates. A 3- and 12-mo risk score was developed using the best model obtained. Results: Logistic regression yielded the best performance at 3 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82) and 12 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.83). A D-R matching system was proposed on the basis of the current model of end-stage liver disease score and cDCD-NRP risk score. Conclusions: The satisfactory performance of the proposed score within the study population suggests a significant potential to support liver allocation in cDCD-NRP grafts. External validation is challenging, but this methodology may be explored in other regions.","tags":[],"title":"Machine Learning Algorithms in Controlled Donation After Circulatory Death Under Normothermic Regional Perfusion: A Graft Survival Prediction Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Bérchez-Moreno","Rafael Ayllón-Gavilán","Vı́ctor Manuel Vargas","David Guijo-Rubio","César Hervás-Martínez","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1740787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740787200,"objectID":"a52abda57650a319e50698e18a245eb9","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/berchez-2025-dlordinal/","publishdate":"2025-02-10T15:54:45.650908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/berchez-2025-dlordinal/","section":"publication","summary":"dlordinal is a new Python library that unifies many recent deep ordinal classification methodologies available in the literature.

When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time-series ordinal classification (TSOC) is the field bridging this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time-series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this article presents the first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state of the art. Both convolutional- and deep-learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29 ordinal problems has been made. In this way, this article contributes to the establishment of the state of the art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.","tags":[],"title":"Convolutional-and Deep Learning-Based Techniques for Time Series Ordinal Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["César Peláez-Rodríguez","Jorge Pérez-Aracil","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","David Guijo-Rubio","Víctor Manuel Vargas","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1733011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733011200,"objectID":"37fd83bee9d3e5662959a21b36474235","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/pelaez-2024-fuzzy/","publishdate":"2025-02-11T10:54:54.710668Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pelaez-2024-fuzzy/","section":"publication","summary":"Providing an accurate prediction of Significant Wave Height (SWH), and specially of extreme SWH events, is crucial for coastal engineering activities and holds major implications in several sectors as offshore renewable energy. With the aim of overcoming the challenge of skewness and imbalance associated with the prediction of these extreme SWH events, a fuzzy-based cascade ensemble of regression models is proposed. This methodology allows to remarkably improve the predictive performance on the extreme SWH values, by using different models specialised in different ranges on the target domain. The method’s explainability is enhanced by analysing the contribution of each model, aiding in identifying those predictor variables more characteristic for the detection of extreme SWH events. The methodology has been validated tackling a long-term SWH prediction problem, considering two case studies over the southwest coast of the United States of America. Both reanalysis data, providing information on various meteorological factors, and SWH measurements, obtained from the nearby stations and the station under examination, have been considered. The goodness of the proposed approach has been validated by comparing its performance against several machine learning and deep learning regression techniques, leading to the conclusion that fuzzy ensemble models perform much better in the prediction of extreme events, at the cost of a slight deterioration in the rest of the samples. The study contributes to advancing the SWH prediction field, specially, to understanding the behaviour behind extreme SWH events, critical for various sectors reliant on oceanic conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Fuzzy-based ensemble methodology for accurate long-term prediction and interpretation of extreme significant wave height events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew Middlehurst","Ali Ismail-Fawaz","Antoine Guillaume","Christopher Holder","David Guijo-Rubio","Guzal Bulatova","Leonidas Tsaprounis","Lukasz Mentel","Martin Walter","Patrick Schäfer","Tony Bagnall"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1725148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1725148800,"objectID":"5e1ec7bd06f28740bbb7c7a902659915","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/middlehurst-2024-aeon/","publishdate":"2025-02-10T16:07:27.979083Z","relpermalink":"/publication/middlehurst-2024-aeon/","section":"publication","summary":" aeon is a unified Python 3 library for all machine learning tasks involving time series.

We aimed to assess these inequities in Spain and to compare the performance of GEMA-Na and MELD 3.0. Methods: Nationwide cohort study including adult patients listed for a first elective LT (January 2016–December 2021). The primary outcome was mortality or delisting for sickness within the first 90 days. Independent predictors of the primary outcome were evaluated using multivariate Cox's regression with adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The discrimination of GEMA-Na and MELD 3.0was assessed using Harrell c-statistics (Hc). Findings: The study included 6071 patients (4697 men and 1374 women). Mortality or delisting for clinical deterioration occurred in 286 patients at 90 days (4.7%). Women had reduced access to LT (83.7% vs. 85.9%; p = 0.037) and increased risk of mortality or delisting for sickness at 90 days (adjusted RR = 1.57 [95% CI 1.09–2.28]; p = 0.017). Female sex remained as an independent risk factor when using MELD or MELD-Na but lost its significance in the presence of GEMA-Na or MELD 3.0.

ORFEO is an artificial neural network model incorporating two outputs, one for ordinal classification, using the cumulative link model, and one for regression, using a linear model. Both outputs are simultaneously optimised considering a loss function that linearly combines both classification and regression losses. The main motivation behind developing the proposed approach is to enhance the performance of a standard ordinal classifier. This improvement is facilitated by considering the regression output, which allows the model to differentiate between patterns within the same category. The ORFEO model is applied to two problems in the field of marine and ocean engineering: short-term prediction of both significant wave height and flux of energy. Both problems are addressed considering four different coastal zones of the United States of America, using 13 datasets formed by buoys measurements and reanalysis data. A comprehensive comparison against 20 methodologies, including regression and nominal/ordinal classification approaches is performed, by using diverse nominal and ordinal performance metrics. Ranks achieved indicate that ORFEO outperforms all the compared methodologies in terms of all the performance measures, demonstrating the efficacy and robustness of the proposal. Finally, a statistical analysis is conducted, concluding that there are statistically significant differences across ordinal and nominal performance metrics in favour of the proposed ORFEO model.","tags":["Ordinal classification","Neural networks","Cumulative link models","Short-term prediction","Significant wave height","Flux of energy","Loss functions"],"title":"ORFEO: Ordinal classifier and Regressor Fusion for Estimating an Ordinal categorical target","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vı́ctor M Vargas","Antonio M Gómez-Orellana","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Bérchez-Moreno","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Mart\\ńez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721668795,"objectID":"293f6089574c0831da2fee936aa0326d","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/vargas-2024-age/","publishdate":"2024-07-22T17:19:55.242348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vargas-2024-age/","section":"publication","summary":"This work explores the use of diverse soft labelling approaches recently proposed in the literature to address four distinct problems in age estimation. This kind of challenge can be considered an ordinal classification problem in machine learning or deep learning areas, as it exhibits a natural order among categories, reflecting the underlying age ranges defining each category. Soft labelling represents a machine learning approach in which, instead of assigning a single label to each instance in the dataset, a probability distribution across a range of labels is allocated. Soft labelling approaches prove particularly effective for age estimation due to the inherent uncertainty and continuity in age progression, which makes accurate age estimation from physical appearance difficult. Unlike categorical labels, age is a continuous variable that evolves over time. Thus, unlike hard labelling, soft labelling more effectively acknowledges the continuity and uncertainty inherent in age estimation. The experiments conducted in this study facilitate the comparison of soft labelling approaches against the nominal baseline. Results demonstrate superior performance of soft labelling approaches.

Results: The study population comprised 9, 320 patients: training cohort n = 5,762, internal validation cohort n = 1, 920, and external validation cohort n = 1, 638. The prevalence of 90-days mortality or delisting for sickness ranged from 5.3% to 6% in the different cohorts. The transition from a linear to a non-linear score (from GEMA-Na to GEMA-AI) resulted in improved discrimination in the internal and external validation cohorts (Hc = 0.766 vs Hc = 0.781; p = 0.035 and Hc = 0.774 vs Hc = 0.793; p = 0.003, respectively), being these differences more pronounced in women (Hc = 0.802 vs Hc = 0.826; p = 0.048 and Hc = 0.796 vs Hc = 0.836; p = 0.014, respectively). Among 1,403 patients (39.4% of the merged validation cohorts) who showed at least one extreme analytical value, GEMA-AI had Hc = 0.823 compared to Hc = 0.797 ( p = 0.036). In this subpopulation, GEMA-AI showed a good calibration (chi-square = 5.04; p = 0.66) whereas GEMA-Na did not (chi-square = 18.94; p = 0.015). A meaningful change ≥2 score prioritization points occurred in 27.8% of patients (11.4% upgraded, 16.4% downgraded). Differential prioritization would occur in 6.4% of the available organs within the first 90 days and would save one in 59 deaths overall, and one in 13 deaths among women. Conclusion: The use of non-linear explainable machine learning models may improve predictions of waiting list outcomes, particularly in the sickest patients showing extreme analytical values. Their use should be preferred over Cox’s regression-based models.","tags":[],"title":"OS-024 The gender-equity model for liver allocation built on artificial intelligence (GEMA-AI) improves outcome predictions among liver transplant candidates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Luis Rodríguez-Perálvarez","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Avik Majumdar","Michael Bailey","Geoffrey W McCaughan","Paul Gow","Marta Guerrero","Rhiannon Taylor","David Guijo-Rubio","César Hervás-Martínez","Emmanuel A Tsochatzis"],"categories":null,"content":"Add the full text or supplementary notes for the publication here using Markdown formatting.\n","date":1714521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714521600,"objectID":"ddadcf9d96c4aa08c7cb7658275a001e","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2024-ilts/","publishdate":"2025-02-11T11:04:28.526321Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2024-ilts/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Current prioritization models for liver transplantation (LT) are hampered by their linear nature, which does not fully capture the severity of patients with extreme analytical values.

For this purpose, we propose the use of a soft labeling approach, which replaces the 0/1 encoding of the classes with soft labels. Specifically, such soft labels or probabilities are obtained from triangular probability distributions, which better distribute the probabilities: the target class receives higher probability than its adjacents classes. Therefore, integrating the soft labeling approach into the loss function modifies the computation of the error during model optimization, now taking into account the ordinal information encoded in the soft labels. For this purpose, an ordinal classification artificial neural network model, termed RNA-T, is implemented and optimized using a categorical cross-entropy loss function that integrates the proposed soft labeling approach. The performance of the RNA-T model is analyzed using two datasets built from reanalysis data and measurements recorded by marine buoys. The RNA-T model is compared, in terms of two ordinal performance metrics, with two standard ordinal classification techniques. The results confirm the superiority of the RNA-T model over the compared techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción a corto plazo de la energía undimotriz mediante un enfoque ordinal de etiquetado suave","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Matthew Middlehurst","Guilherme Arcencio","Diego Furtado Silva","Anthony Bagnall"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716195484,"objectID":"b0138b43ae14410bcec605a6f58fea5c","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/tser-david-2024/","publishdate":"2024-05-20T08:58:04.889039Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tser-david-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) involves using a set of training time series to form a predictive model of a continuous response variable that is not directly related to the regressor series.

Although feasible, predicting extreme wind with supervised classifiers and deep learning models is particularly difficult because of the low frequency of these events, which leads to highly unbalanced training datasets. To tackle this challenge, in this paper different traditional data augmentation techniques, such as random oversampling, SMOTE, time series data warping and multidimensional data warping, are used to generate synthetic samples of extreme wind and its predictors, such as previous samples of wind speed and meteorological variables of the surroundings. Results show that using data augmentation techniques with the right oversampling ratio leads to improvement in extreme wind prediction with most machine learning and deep learning models tested.

Despite their commendable efficiency and minimal environmental impact, wind energy faces challenges such as stochasticity and intermittence. Machine learning methods offer a promising avenue for mitigating these challenges, particularly through wind speed prediction, which is crucial for optimising wind turbine performance. One important aspect to consider, regardless of the methodology employed and the approach used to tackle the wind speed prediction problem, is the prediction horizon. Most of the works in the literature have been designed to deal with a single prediction horizon. However, in this study, we propose a multi-task learning framework capable of simultaneously handling various prediction horizons. For this purpose, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are considered, specifically a multilayer perceptron. Our study focuses on medium- and long-term prediction horizons (6 h, 12 h, and 24 h ahead), using wind speed data collected over ten years from a Spanish wind farm, along with ERA5 reanalysis variables that serve as input for the wind speed prediction. The results obtained indicate that the proposed multi-task model performing the three prediction horizons simultaneously can achieve comparable performance to corresponding single-task models while offering simplicity in terms of lower complexity, which includes the number of neurons and links, as well as computational resources.","tags":[],"title":"Medium-and Long-Term Wind Speed Prediction Using the Multi-task Learning Paradigm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Holder","David Guijo-Rubio","Anthony Bagnall"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703923552,"objectID":"a03425a4bfe335de45c77ddf3cfcad41","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/holder-2023-barycentre/","publishdate":"2023-12-30T08:05:51.958191Z","relpermalink":"/publication/holder-2023-barycentre/","section":"publication","summary":"Distance functions play a core role in many time series machine learning algorithms for tasks such as clustering, classification and regression. Time series often require bespoke distance functions because small offsets in time can lead to large distances between series that are conceptually similar. Elastic distances compensate for misalignment by creating a path through a cost matrix by warping and/or editing time series. Time series are most commonly clustered with partitional algorithms such as k-means and k-medoids using elastic distance measures such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The distance is used to assign cases to the closest cluster representative. k-means requires the averaging of time series to find these representative centroids. If DTW is used to assign membership, but the arithmetic mean is used to find centroids, k-means performance degrades significantly. An averaging technique specific to DTW, called DTW Barycentre Averaging (DBA), overcomes the averaging problem. However, can only be used with DTW. As such alternative distance functions such as Move-Split-Merge (MSM) are forced to use the arithmetic mean to compute new centroids and suffer similar degraded performance as k-means-DTW without DBA. To address this we propose a averaging method for MSM distance, MSM Barycentre Averaging (MBA) and show that when used to find centroids it significantly improves MSM based k-means and is better than commonly used alternatives","tags":[],"title":"Barycentre Averaging for the Move-Split-Merge Time Series Distance Measure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael Calleja","Marcos Rivera","Amelia J.

Predicting an ordinal variable, that is, a variable that demonstrates a natural relationship between categories, is of relevance for a number of real-world problems in various fields of knowledge. For example, a medical diagnosis can occur at different stages of the disease. Applying standard classifiers to ordered labels can lead to errors in distant categories, when errors in an ordinal problem ideally tend to be produced in adjacent classes because of their similarity. To address this issue, we propose a soft labelling approach based on generalised triangular distributions, which are asymmetric and different for each class. The parameters of these distributions are determined using a metaheuristic and are specifically adapted to the given problem. Moreover, this approach enables the model to avoid errors in distant classes (e.g. classifying a patient with a severe disease as healthy). A comprehensive comparison was performed using eight datasets and five performance metrics. The main advantage of the proposed soft-labelling approach is that it adapts the distributions to each problem, resulting in greater flexibility and better performance. The results and statistical analysis show that the proposed methodology significantly outperforms all other methods.","tags":["Soft labelling","Ordinal classification","Deep learning","Dynamic barebones explotation PSO","Generalised triangular distribution"],"title":"Generalised triangular distributions for ordinal deep learning: Novel proposal and optimisation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio M.

The methodology is specifically applied to Significant Wave Height (SWH) time series in the field of marine engineering. The proposed approach involves two phases. Firstly, the SWH time series for each buoy is independently reconstructed using three transfer function models: regression-based, correlation-based, and distance-based. The distance-based transfer function exhibits the best overall performance. Secondly, Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs) are utilised for the final recovery of each time series, using as inputs highly correlated buoys that have been intermediately recovered. The EANNs are evolved considering two metrics, the novel squared error relevance area, which balances the importance of extreme and around-mean values, and the well-known mean squared error. The study considers SWH time series data from 15 buoys in two coastal zones in the United States. The results demonstrate that the distance-based transfer function is generally the best transfer function, and that EANNs outperform a range of state-of-the-art ML techniques in 12 out of the 15 buoys, with a number of connections comparable to linear models. Furthermore, the proposed methodology outperforms the two most popular approaches for time series reconstruction, BRITS and SAITS, for all buoys except one. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides a promising approach, which may be applied to time series from other fields, such as wind or solar energy farms in the field of green energy.","tags":["Time series reconstruction","Marine engineering","Wave height reconstruction","Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks","Ocean buoys"],"title":"An Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network approach for spatio-temporal wave height time series reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Dı́az-Lozano","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688192836,"objectID":"45bd4c0fc541c9b8feedcf843b6eb387","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/diaz-2023-cluster/","publishdate":"2023-07-01T06:27:16.088744Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diaz-2023-cluster/","section":"publication","summary":"The sanitary emergency caused by COVID-19 has compromised countries and generated a worldwide health and economic crisis. To provide support to the countries’ responses, numerous lines of research have been developed. The spotlight was put on effectively and rapidly diagnosing and predicting the evolution of the pandemic, one of the most challenging problems of the past months. This work contributes to the existing literature by developing a two-step methodology to analyze the transmission rate, designing models applied to territories with similar pandemic behavior characteristics. Virus transmission is considered as bacterial growth curves to understand the spread of the virus and to make predictions about its future evolution. Hence, an analytical clustering procedure is first applied to create groups of locations where the virus transmission rate behaved similarly in the different outbreaks. A curve decomposition process based on an iterative polynomial process is then applied, obtaining meaningful forecasting features. Information of the territories belonging to the same cluster is merged to build models capable of simultaneously predicting the 14-day incidence in several locations using Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks. The methodology is applied to Andalusia (Spain), although it is applicable to any region across the world. Individual models trained for a specific territory are carried out for comparison purposes. The results demonstrate that this methodology achieves statistically similar, or even better, performance for most of the locations. In addition to being extremely competitive, the main advantage of the proposal lies in its complexity cost reduction. The total number of parameters to be estimated is reduced up to 93.51% for the short term and 93.31% for the mid-term forecasting, respectively.

A popular approach to TSCL is to use the partitional clustering algorithms k-means or k-medoids in conjunction with an elastic distance function such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We explore TSCL using nine different elastic distance measures. Both partitional algorithms characterise clusters with an exemplar series, but use different techniques to do so: k-means uses an averaging algorithm to find an exemplar, whereas k-medoids chooses a training case (medoid). Traditionally, the arithmetic mean of a collection of time series was used with k-means. However, this ignores any offset. In 2011, an averaging technique specific to DTW, called DTW Barycentre Averaging (DBA), was proposed. Since, k-means with DBA has been the algorithm of choice for the majority of partition-based TSCL and much of the research using medoids-based approaches for TSCL stopped. We revisit k-medoids based TSCL with a range of elastic distance measures. Our results show k-medoids approaches are significantly better than k-means on a standard test suite, independent of the elastic distance measure used. We also compare the most commonly used alternating k-medoids approach against the Partition Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm. PAM significantly outperforms the default k-medoids for all nine elastic measures used. Additionally, we evaluate six variants of PAM designed to speed up TSCL. Finally, we show PAM with the best elastic distance measure is significantly better than popular alternative TSCL algorithms, including the k-means DBA approach, and competitive with the best deep learning algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Clustering Time Series with k-Medoids Based Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rafael Ayllón-Gavilán","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696689697,"objectID":"bccb58e72a7137b6a51da0a3ad84abf5","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/ayllon-2023-dictionary/","publishdate":"2023-10-07T14:41:37.456409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ayllon-2023-dictionary/","section":"publication","summary":"Time Series Classification (TSC) is an extensively researched field from which a broad range of real-world problems can be addressed obtaining excellent results.

Typically, D-R matching is performed following the knowledge of a team of experts guided by the use of a prioritisation system. One of the most extended, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), aims to decrease the mortality in the waiting list. However, it does not take into account the result of the transplant. In this sense, with the aim of developing a system able to bear in mind the survival benefit, we propose to treat the problem as an ordinal classification one. The organ survival will be predicted at four different thresholds. The results achieved demonstrate that ordinal classifiers are capable of outperforming nominal approaches in the state-of-the-art. Finally, this methodology can help experts make more informed decisions about the appropriateness of assigning a recipient for a specific donor, maximising the probability of post-transplant survival in LT.","tags":[],"title":"Ordinal Classification Approach for Donor-Recipient Matching in Liver Transplantation with Circulatory Death Donors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Luis Rodríguez-Perálvarez","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Avik Majumdar","Michael Bailey","Geoffrey W McCaughan","Paul Gow","Marta Guerrero","Rhiannon Taylor","David Guijo-Rubio","César Hervás-Martínez","Emmanuel A Tsochatzis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703923761,"objectID":"7b7b524ef0c3178630d26c87354835fb","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2023-ilts/","publishdate":"2023-12-30T08:09:21.588053Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2023-ilts/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Models for liver transplant (LT) allocation have been trained to predict mortality or delisting for sickness at 90 days. Their performance in a context of waiting list shortening is uncertain. Methods: Retrospective study of two cohorts of patients enlisted for LT in the UK (2010-2020) and Australia (1997-2020). Mortality or delisting for sickness within the first 30 and 60 days was evaluated. Harrell’s c statistics (Hc) were used to assess discrimination. Results: In all, 7,133 patients from the UK (33% women) and 1,638 patients from Australia (26.4% women) were included. Mortality or delisting for sickness at 30 and 60 days were 2.6% and 4.5% in the UK, and 2.7% and 4.6% in Australia. In the UK at 30 days, GEMA-Na obtained the highest discrimination (Hc=0.818; 95%CI 0.783-0.853), followed by MELD-Na (Hc=0.796; 95%CI 0.759-0.834; p=0.004), and MELD 3.0 (Hc=0.782; 95%CI 0.743-0.821; p\u003c0.001). In Australia at 30 days, the most accurate forecasts came from GEMA-Na (Hc=0.832; 95%CI 0.770-0.894), followed by MELD 3.0 (Hc=0.805; 95%CI 0.737-0.872; p=0.030), and MELD-Na (Hc=0.789; 95%CI 0.717-0.861; p=0.018). The discrimination benefit of GEMA-Na at 30 days was more pronounced in women: Hc=0.824 (95%CI 0.767-0.822) in the UK, and Hc=0.856 (95%CI 0.768-0.944) in Australia. Results were similar at 60 days. Differential prioritization at 30 days occurred in 15% of patients when comparing GEMA-Na vs MELD-Na, and in 15.3% of patients when comparing GEMA-Na vs MELD 3.0. Patients differently prioritized by GEMA-Na over MELD-Na had higher risk of the outcome at 30 days (OR=2.5; p=0.043) and at 60 days (OR=4.2; p=0.005). Patients differently prioritized by GEMA-Na over MELD 3.0 had increased likelihood of the outcome at 30 days (OR=7.3; p=0.009) and at 60 days (OR=3.8; p=0.004).

We aimed to derive and validate the Gender-Equity Model for liver Allocation (GEMA) and its sodium-corrected variant (GEMA-Na) to amend such inequities. Methods In this cohort study, the GEMA models were derived by replacing creatinine with the Royal Free Hospital glomerular filtration rate (RFH-GFR) within the MELD and MELD-Na formulas, with re-fitting and re-weighting of each component. The new models were trained and internally validated in adults listed for liver transplantation in the UK (2010–20; UK Transplant Registry) using generalised additive multivariable Cox regression, and externally validated in an Australian cohort (1998–2020; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [Australian National Liver Transplant Unit] and Austin Hospital [Victorian Liver Transplant Unit]). The study comprised 9320 patients: 5762 patients for model training, 1920 patients for internal validation, and 1638 patients for external validation. The primary outcome was mortality or delisting due to clinical deterioration within the first 90 days from listing. Discrimination was assessed by Harrell's concordance statistic. Findings 449 (5·8%) of 7682 patients in the UK cohort and 87 (5·3%) of 1638 patients in the Australian cohort died or were delisted because of clinical deterioration within 90 days. GEMA showed improved discrimination in predicting mortality or delisting due to clinical deterioration within the first 90 days after waiting list inclusion compared with MELD (Harrell's concordance statistic 0·752 [95% CI 0·700–0·804] vs 0·712 [0·656–0·769]; p=0·001 in the internal validation group and 0·761 [0·703–0·819] vs 0·739 [0·682–0·796]; p=0·036 in the external validation group), and GEMA-Na showed improved discrimination compared with MELD-Na (0·766 [0·715–0·818] vs 0·742 [0·686–0·797]; p=0·0058 in the internal validation group and 0·774 [0·720–0·827] vs 0·745 [0·690–0·800]; p=0·014 in the external validation group). The discrimination capacity of GEMA-Na was higher in women than in the overall population, both in the internal (0·802 [0·716–0·888]) and external validation cohorts (0·796 [0·698–0·895]). In the pooled validation cohorts, GEMA resulted in a score change of at least 2 points compared with MELD in 1878 (52·8%) of 3558 patients (25·0% upgraded and 27·8% downgraded). GEMA-Na resulted in a score change of at least 2 points compared with MELD-Na in 1836 (51·6%) of 3558 patients (32·3% upgraded and 19·3% downgraded). In the whole cohort, 3725 patients received a transplant within 90 days of being listed. Of these patients, 586 (15·7%) would have been differently prioritised by GEMA compared with MELD; 468 (12·6%) patients would have been differently prioritised by GEMA-Na compared with MELD-Na. One in 15 deaths could potentially be avoided by using GEMA instead of MELD and one in 21 deaths could potentially be avoided by using GEMA-Na instead of MELD-Na. Interpretation GEMA and GEMA-Na showed improved discrimination and a significant re-classification benefit compared with existing scores, with consistent results in an external validation cohort. Their implementation could save a clinically meaningful number of lives, particularly among women, and could amend current gender inequities in accessing liver transplantation.

The proposed XAI-EANN model architecture has been applied to each of the defined sub-regions, in order to find significant differences among them, which can be explained with the XAI-EANN models obtained. Finally, a comprehensive comparison against some state-of-the-art techniques has also been carried out, concluding that there are statistically significant differences in terms of accuracy in favour of the proposed XAI-EANN model, which also benefits from being an XAI model.","tags":[],"title":"One month in advance prediction of air temperature from Reanalysis data with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Luis Rodríguez-Perálvarez","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Avik Majumdar","María Dolores Ayllón","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Pilar Barrera Baena","David Guijo-Rubio","César Hervás-Martínez","Manuel de la Mata","Emmanuel A Tsochatzis"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703924191,"objectID":"703fec1036c2e913124eda23834e100f","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2023-aeeh/","publishdate":"2023-12-30T08:16:31.087085Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguezperalvarez-2023-aeeh/","section":"publication","summary":"Introducción: Los modelos de priorización en lista de espera de trasplante hepático (TH) han sido entrenados para predecir mortalidad en lista a 90 días. Sin embargo, muchos centros tienen listas de espera más cortas, lo cual podría cuestionar su utilidad. Métodos: Estudio observacional en dos cohortes poblacionales de adultos incluidos en lista de espera de TH electivo. El evento principal del estudio fue la mortalidad en lista o la salida de lista por empeoramiento en los primeros 30 días o 60 días tras la inclusión. Se utilizó el estadístico c de Harrell (Hc) para comparar la capacidad discriminativa de los modelos MELD-Na, MELD 3.0 y GEMA-Na (Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation; Rodríguez-Perálvarez et al. Lancet Gastro Hepatol, en prensa). Resultados: Se incluyeron 7.133 pacientes del Reino Unido (33% mujeres) y 1.638 pacientes (26,4% mujeres) de Australia. La probabilidad de mortalidad o salida de lista por empeoramiento a 30 días y a 60 días fue de 2,6% y 4,5% en la cohorte británica, y de 2,7% y 4,6% en la cohorte australiana. En la cohorte británica a los 30 días, el modelo con mejor discriminación fue GEMA-Na (Hc = 0,818; IC95% 0,783-0,853), seguido de MELD-Na (Hc = 0,796; IC95% 0,759-0,834; p = 0,004), y MELD 3.0 (Hc = 0,782; IC95% 0,743-0,821; p \u003c 0,001). En la cohorte australiana a los 30 días, el modelo que mostró mejores predicciones fue GEMA-Na (Hc = 0,832; IC95% 0,770- 0,894), seguido de MELD 3.0 (Hc = 0,805; IC95% 0,737-0,872; p = 0,030), y MELD-Na (Hc = 0,789; IC95% 0,717-0,861; p = 0,018). Estos resultados fueron superponibles en el análisis a 60 días. La ventaja de GEMA-Na frente al resto de modelos fue más pronunciada en el subgrupo de mujeres, donde obtuvo Hc = 0,824 (IC95% 0,767-0,882) a los 30 días y Hc = 0,814 (IC95% 0,770-0,858) a los 60 días en la cohorte británica, y Hc = 0,856 (IC95% 0,768-0,944) a los 30 días y Hc = 0,784 (IC95% 0,680-0,889) a los 60 días en la cohorte australiana. En la cohorte total, el 51,6% de los pacientes modificarían su puntuación en dos o más puntos al comparar GEMA-Na con MELD-Na. Se realizaron 1,977 trasplantes a los 30 días (22,5%) y 3,013 trasplantes a los 60 días (34,4%). Comparando GEMA-Na con MELD-Na, existió priorización diferencial en 15% y 10,4% de los pacientes a 30 y 60 días, respectivamente. Comparando GEMA-Na con MELD3.0, existió priorización diferencial en 15,3% y 12,8% de los pacientes a 30 y 60 días, respectivamente. Los pacientes diferencialmente priorizados por GEMA-Na vs. MELD-Na presentaron mayor riesgo del evento principal a 30 días (OR = 2,5; p = 0,043) y 60 días (OR = 4,2; p = 0,005). Del mismo modo, Los pacientes diferencialmente priorizados por GEMA-Na vs. MELD 3.0 presentaron mayor riesgo del evento principal a 30 días (OR = 7,3; p = 0,009) y 60 días (OR = 3,8; p = 0,004).

Then, the extracted information is used for estimating the parameters and structure of an evolutionary artificial neural network with hybrid architectures (i.e., with different basis functions for the hidden nodes) while considering single and simultaneous time horizon estimations. The results obtained demonstrate that including polynomial information extracted during the training stage significantly improves the mid- and long-term estimations in seven of the eight considered districts.

We derived and   validated a new model that replaced creatinine with the Royal Free   glomerular filtration rate (PMID: 27779785) within the MELD and   MELD-Na formulas.   Method: The “Gender-Equity Model for liver Allocation” (GEMA) and   its sodium-corrected variant (GEMA-Na) were trained and internally   validated in adults listed for LT in the United Kingdom (2010–2020)   using generalized additive multivariate Cox regression. The models   were externally validated in an Australian cohort (1998–2020). The   primary outcome was mortality or delisting due to clinical deterior-   ation at 90 days. The Greenwood-Nam-D’Agostino test was used to   test calibration.   Results: The study comprised 9, 320 patients: 5, 762 patients for   model training, 1, 920 patients for internal validation, and 1, 638   patients for external validation. The prevalence of the primary   outcome ranged from 5.3% to 6%. In the internal validation cohort,   GEMA and GEMA-Na showed a Harrell’s c-statistic = 0.752 and 0.766,   respectively, for the primary outcome, which were significantly   higher than those of the MELD score (0.712) and the MELD-Na score   (0.742). Results were consistent in the external validation cohort.   Among women, these differences were more pronounced (see   Harrell’s c-statistics in the table). GEMA and GEMA-Na were   adequately calibrated and prioritized differently 43.9% and 41.8% of    LT patients, respectively. Patients prioritized by GEMA-Na were more   often women, had higher prevalence of ascites and showed triple risk   of the primary outcome compared to patients prioritized by MELD-   Na. One in 15 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA instead of   MELD, and 1 in 21 deaths would be avoided by using GEMA-Na   instead of MELD-Na.

Results obtained show a pronounced difference in terms of performance obtained by all the TSC models when applied to the original dataset against the randomized one.

To simultaneously predict both wave parameters, this paper presents a novel approach using short-term time prediction horizons (6h and 12h). Specifically, the methodology proposed presents a twofold simultaneity: 1) both parameters are predicted by a single model, applying the multi-task learning paradigm, and 2) the prediction tasks are tackled for several neighbouring ocean buoys with such single model by the development of a zonal strategy. Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network (MTEANN) models are applied to two different zones located in the United States, considering measurements collected by three buoys in each zone. Zonal MTEANN models have been compared in a two-phased procedure: 1) against the three individual MTEANN models specifically trained for each buoy of the zone, and 2) against some state-of-the-art regression techniques. Results achieved show that the proposed zonal methodology obtains not only better performance than the individual MTEANN models, but it also requires a lower number of connections. Besides, the zonal MTEANN methodology outperforms state-of-the-art regression techniques. Hence, the proposed approach results in an excellent method for predicting both significant wave height and flux of energy at short-term prediction time horizons.","tags":["Wave height prediction","Energy flux prediction","Marine energy","Multi-task machine learning","Zonal models","Evolutionary artificial neural networks"],"title":"Simultaneous short-term significant wave height and energy flux prediction using zonal multi-task evolutionary artificial neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Alicia Troncoso","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"778bd0091fe39acced556c5e1f0fba6d","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.206767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/clustering-guijo-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Time-series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance mea- sure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different sub- sequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time-series objects of the dataset. In this article, we propose a novel technique of time-series clustering consisting of two clustering stages. In a first step, a least-squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all of the segments are pro- jected into the same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statisti- cal features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another spe- cific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time-series objects are grouped. We consider internal clus- tering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against three state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising, especially on larger datasets.","tags":["Time series clustering","data mining","segmentation","feature extraction"],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Victor Manuel Vargas","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Javier Barbero-Gómez","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1634169600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619612696,"objectID":"95bd992cd9a47c2d0d0112c18cee20cb","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/guijo-docencia-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:56.697745Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guijo-docencia-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Data Science is the area that comprises the development of scientific methods, processes, and systems for extracting knowledge from previously collected data, aiming to analyse the procedures being carried out currently.

Traditionally, artificial neural networks mainly used the sigmoid activation function as the depth of the network was limited. Nevertheless, this function tends to saturate the gradients when the number of hidden layers increases. For that reason, in the last years, most of the works published related to deep learning and convolutional networks use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), given that it provides good convergence properties and speeds up the training process thanks to the simplicity of its derivative. However, this function has some known drawbacks that gave rise to new proposals of alternatives activation functions based on ReLU. In this work, we describe, analyse and compare different recently proposed alternatives to test whether these functions improve the performance of deep learning models regarding the standard ReLU.","tags":["\"analysis activations\"","\"RELU\"","\"RELU activations\"","\"deep learning\""],"title":"ReLU-based activations: analysis and experimental study for deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Víctor Manuel Vargas-Yun","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621845021,"objectID":"821177b003c62ded12a80cb7064eb19c","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/guijo-caepia-2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-24T08:30:21.786941Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guijo-caepia-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is yet an unexplored field of machine learning consisting in the classification of time series whose labels follow a natural order relationship between them. In this context, a well-known approach for time series nominal classification was previously used: the Shapelet Transform (ST). The exploitation of the ordinal information was included in two steps of the ST algorithm: 1) by using the Pearson's determination coefficient (R2) for computing the quality of the shapelets, which favours shapelets with better ordering, and 2) by applying an ordinal classifier instead of a nominal one to the transformed dataset. For this, the distance between labels was represented by the absolute value of the difference between the corresponding ranks, i.e. by the L1 norm. In this paper, we study the behaviour of different Lp norms for representing class distances in ordinal regression, evaluating 9 different Lp norms with 7 ordinal time series datasets from the UEA-UCR time series classification repository and 10 different ordinal classifiers. The results achieved demonstrate that the Pearson's determination coefficient using the L1.9 norm in the computation of the difference between the shapelet and the time series labels achieves a significantly better performance when compared to the rest of the approaches, in terms of both Correct Classification Rate (CCR) and Average Mean Absolute Error (AMAE).

In this sense, we consider four different evaluation metrics to do so, three of them of an ordinal nature. The first one is the widely known Information Gain (IG), proved to be very competitive for ST methods, whereas the remaining three measures try to boost the order information by refining the quality measure. These three measures are a reformulation of the Fisher score, the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ), and finally, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R²).

The diagnosis of convective clouds is key in a large airport like Barajas, since these meteorological events are associated with strong winds and local precipitation, which may affect air and land operations at the airport. In this work, we deal with a 12-h time horizon in the analysis of convective clouds, using as input variables data from a radiosonde station and also from numerical weather models. The information about the objective variable (convective clouds presence at the airport) has been obtained from the Madrid-Barajas METAR and SPECI aeronautical reports. We treat the problem as an ordinal regression task, where there exist a natural order among the classes. Moreover, the classification problem is highly imbalanced, since there are very few convective clouds events compared to clear days. Thus, a process of oversampling is applied to the database in order to obtain a better balance of the samples for this specific problem. An important number of ordinal regression methods are then tested in the experimental part of the work, showing that the best approach for this problem is the SVORIM algorithm, based on the Support Vector Machine strategy, but adapted for ordinal regression problems. The SVORIM algorithm shows a good accuracy in the case of thunderstorms and Cumulonimbus clouds, which represent a real hazard for the airport operations.","tags":["Convective clouds","Convective analysis","Airports","Machine learning techniques","Ordinal regression"],"title":"Ordinal regression algorithms for the analysis of convective situations over Madrid-Barajas airport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Javier Jiménez-Romero","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Ramón Lara-Raya","Antonio Ruiz-González","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619601590,"objectID":"adaef923da0fb1eb4e1a88e231eadac6","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:21:26.3612Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ap-acoustics-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"In the last decade, the sound quality of electric induction motors is a hot topic in the research field. Specially, due to its high number of applications, the population is exposed to physical and psychological discomfort caused by the noise emission. Therefore, it is necessary to minimise its psychological impact on the population. In this way, the main goal of this work is to evaluate the use of multitask artificial neural networks as a modelling technique for simultaneously predicting psychoacoustic parameters of induction motors. Several inputs are used, such as, the electrical magnitudes of the motor power signal and the number of poles, instead of separating the noise of the electric motor from the environmental noise. Two different kind of artificial neural networks are proposed to evaluate the acoustic quality of induction motors, by using the equivalent sound pressure, the loudness, the roughness and the sharpness as outputs. Concretely, two different topologies have been considered: simple models and more complex models. The former are more interpretable, while the later lead to higher accuracy at the cost of hiding the cause-effect relationship.

In this paper we evaluate the capacity of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks to predict the formation of convective clouds, tackling the problem as a classification task. We use data from Madrid-Barajas airport, including variables and indices derived from the Madrid-Barajas airport radiosonde station. As objective variable, we use the cloud information contained in the METAR and SPECI meteorological reports from the same airport and we consider a prediction time-horizon of 12 hours. The performance of different types of evolutionary artificial neural networks has been discussed and analysed, including three types of basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Product Unit and Radial Basis Function), and two types of models, a mono-objective evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm optimised by the two objective functions simultaneously. We show that some of the developed neuro-evolutionary models obtain high quality solutions to this problem, due to its high unbalance characteristic.","tags":["Convection initialization prediction","machine learning algorithms","neural networks","unbalanced databases"],"title":"Prediction of convective clouds formation using evolutionary neural computation techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Gómez-Orellana","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"a81c21ce816c214708181714ca9cb76a","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:53.415905Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ocean-engineering-guijo-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a novel approach to tackle simultaneously short- and long-term energy flux prediction (specifically, at 6h, 12h, 24h and 48h time horizons). The methodology proposed is based on the Multi-Task Learning paradigm in order to solve the four problems with a single model. We consider Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (MTEANN) with four outputs, one for each time prediction horizon. For this purpose, three buoys located at the Gulf of Alaska are considered. Measurements collected by these buoys are used to obtain the target values of energy flux, whereas, only reanalysis data are used as input values, allowing the applicability to other locations. The performance of three different basis functions (Sigmoidal Unit, Radial Basis Function and Product Unit) are compared against some popular stateof-the-art approaches such as Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector Regressors. The results show that MTEANN methodology using Sigmoidal Units in the hidden layer and a linear output achieves the best performance. In this way, the multi-task methodology is an excellent and lower-complexity approach for energy flux prediction at both short- and long-term prediction time horizons. Furthermore, the results also confirm that reanalysis data is enough for describing well the problem tackled.","tags":["Ocean Engineering","Flux of energy prediction"],"title":"Short- and long-term energy flux prediction using Multi-Task Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antonio Rivero-Juárez","David Guijo-Rubio","Francisco Téllez","Rosario Palacios","Dolores Merino","Juan Macías","Juan Carlos Fernández","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Antonio Rivero","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619602673,"objectID":"95436819a8720f2c457e0ae03855ea0c","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/vih-ann-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T09:37:52.989254Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vih-ann-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Several European countries have established criteria for prioritising initiation of treatment in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by grouping patients according to clinical characteristics.

This study was based on the Spanish HERACLES cohort (NCT02511496) (April-September 2015, 2940 patients) and involved application of different neural network models with different basis functions (product-unit, sigmoid unit and radial basis function neural networks) for automatic classification of patients for treatment. An evolutionary algorithm was used to determine the architecture and estimate the coefficients of the model. This machine learning methodology found that radial basis neural networks provided a very simple model in terms of the number of patient characteristics to be considered by the classifier (in this case, six), returning a good overall classification accuracy of 0.767 and a minimum sensitivity (for the classification of the minority class, untreated patients) of 0.550. Finally, the area under the ROC curve was 0.802, which proved to be exceptional. The parsimony of the model makes it especially attractive, using just eight connections. The independent variable \"recent PWID\" is compulsory due to its importance.

Shapelets have proved to be very effective primitives for time series classification. The two most prominent shapelet based classification algorithms are the shapelet transform (ST) and learned shapelets (LS). One significant difference between these approaches is that ST is data driven, whereas LS searches the entire shapelet space through stochastic gradient descent. The weakness of the former is that full enumeration of possible shapelets is very time consuming. The problem with the latter is that it is very dependent on the initialisation of the shapelets. We propose hybridising the two approaches through a pipeline that includes a time constrained data driven shapelet search which is then passed to a neural network architecture of learned shapelets for tuning. The tuned shapelets are extracted and formed into a transform, which is then classified with a rotation forest. We show that this hybrid approach is significantly better than either approach in isolation, and that the resulting classifier is not significantly worse than a full shapelet search.","tags":[],"title":"A hybrid approach to time series classification with shapelets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro J.

The design of accurate predictors for low-visibility events can be approached by modelling future visibility conditions based on past values of different input variables, recorded at the airport. The use of autoregressive time series forecasters involves adjusting the order of the model (number of past series values or size of the sliding window), which usually depends on the dynamical nature of the time series. Moreover, the same window size is normally used for all the data, thought it would be reasonable to use different sliding windows. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for daily low-visibility events, which combines fixed-size and dynamic windows, and adapts its size according to the dynamics of the time series. Moreover, visibility is labelled using three ordered categories (FOG, MIST and CLEAR), and the prediction is then carried out by means of ordinal classifiers, in order to take advantage of the ordinal nature of low-visibility events. We evaluate the model using a dataset from Valladolid airport (Spain), where radiation fog is very common in autumn and winter months. The considered data set includes five different meteorological input variables (wind speed and direction, temperature, relative humidity and QNH - pressure adjusted at mean sea level) and the Runway Visual Range (RVR), which is used to characterize the low-visibility events at the airport. The results show that the proposed hybrid window model with ordinal classification leads to very robust performance prediction in daily time-horizon, improving the results obtained by the persistence model and alternative prediction schemes tested.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of low-visibility events due to fog using ordinal classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Guijo-Rubio","Antonio Manuel Durán-Rosal","Antonio Gómez-Orellana","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619612884,"objectID":"fe664a72d4d11129e5f2418b80df766e","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/guijo-ideal-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:28:04.338721Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guijo-ideal-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Wave height prediction is an important task for ocean and marine resource management.

Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmentation. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.","tags":[],"title":"Time series clustering based on the characterisation of segment typologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Diaz-Lozano","David Guijo-Rubio","Pedro Antonio Gutiérrez","Carlos Casanova-Mateo","Sancho Salcedo-Sanz","César Hervás-Martínez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619612697,"objectID":"6563fd3f68f5b81b7bae523ddece1580","permalink":"https://dguijo.com/publication/diaz-caepia-2018/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T12:24:57.620571Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diaz-caepia-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Los eventos de muy baja visibilidad producidos por niebla son un problema recurrente en ciertas zonas cercanas a rı́os y grandes montañas, que afectan fuertemente a la actividad humana en diferentes aspectos.
